code and project related files reside in src.
Main 3 programs are crypt.py , decrypt.py , attack_LLL.py where each program performs encryption,decryption and cracking/attacking respectively.
To run all these programs together we have given a main.py file which runs each of these programs step by step.

command : python main.py

Some cases it might give an error that python is not installed because we have imported os library , just install python in windows microsoft store.
Also in some rare cases program excecution stops, in that case just press enter key and it continous the execution.
Or for clean execution for step by step process we can excecute 3 main python files individually by :

python crypt.py
python decrypt.py
python attack_LLL.py


Results will printed in terminal and also stored in result folder in respective txt files. 

text_clear will store the final cracked encrypted text which is present in root folder of the project.
	

With regard to video explanation:
The order of explanation is Sheel(intro&keygen),Sarthak(encryp&decrypt),Jay(attacking),Shushal(results and output demonstration).
